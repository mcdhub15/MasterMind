# MasterMind
using the git to document incremental build of a MasterMind game
I would like to use the MasterMind project as a teaching tool to help students understand 
decomposition and procedural abstraction.    I would love to hear from other developers how
they approach a problem and connect data to code.

We will attempt to use Github to manage version control and write code in a team.
